    "solution": "We begin by simplifying the two rightmost 6Ω resistors in parallel: 1/R = (⅙Ω + ⅙Ω)  = 3Ω. Next, we can add the series 3Ω resistor connected to this, R = 3Ω + 3Ω = 6Ω. Now, this 6Ω is in parallel with that diagonal 6Ω resistor, 1/R = (⅙Ω + ⅙Ω) = 3Ω. This 3Ω is then added in series with the bottom 3Ω resistor, R = 3Ω + 3Ω = 6Ω. Now, this 6Ω is in parallel with the middle 3Ω resistor, 1/R = ⅓Ω  + ⅙Ω = 2Ω. This 2Ω result is now in parallel with the diagonal 2Ω resistor, 1/R = ½ + ½ = 1. Finally, we add the 9Ω resistor in series, R = 9Ω + 1Ω = 10Ω ",
